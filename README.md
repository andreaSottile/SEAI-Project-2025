# Decoding-free Two-Input Arithmetic: Case Posit8
In this project, we present an extension to the implementation of Posit8 to implement decoding-free arithmetic.
It implements an interactive menu that allows the user to quickly run the three versions of the developed code with **Posit** numbers (specifically `Posit(4,0)`, `Posit(6,0)`, and `Posit(8,0)`), leveraging a *Decoding-Free* approach and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
matlab results/         % Output JSON files generated by MATLAB scripts
positlist/              % Definitions and utilities for Posit types
profiler results/       % MATLAB PROFILER output data (HTML)
python results/         % Output from post-processing Python scripts

manual_main.m           % Main manual for executions, particularly for Posit(8,0)
main.m                  % Entry point: starts the DFP System Console
post_solve.py           % Python script for post-processing results
solveMapping.m          % Classic mode solver
solveMapping_parallel.m % Parallel mode solver
solveMapping_speed.m    % Speed-optimized solver
```

## How to Run
To start the **DFP System Console**, simply run the following script in MATLAB:
```matlab
main.m
```
This will launch the interactive console interface to select the mode, Posit type, operation, and output format.

## Features
- Interactive console interface for selecting mapping mode, Posit type, and arithmetic operation
- Supports the following operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**
- Three solving modes:
  - **Classic**: baseline algorithm
  - **Parallel**: parallel execution
  - **Speed**: optimized for performance
- Results exportable in JSON format
- Final lookup table optimized through ILP solving

## Usage
On startup, the system prompts the user to select the mapping mode:
```
1. Classic
2. Parallel
3. Speed
4. Exit
```
Then, select the Posit type:
```
1. Posit(4,0)
2. Posit(6,0)
3. Posit(8,0)
```
Next, choose the desired operation:
```
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
```
Finally, specify the JSON output filename:
```
Output JSON file name (e.g., result.json):
```
## Output
The system runs an Integer Linear Programming optimization (using `intlinprog`) to construct a **lookup table** that maps operand combinations (`Lx`, `Ly`) to a set `Lz`, from which the result of the operation is retrieved

Sample output (simplified):

```
Mapping Lx (first operand):
 0  1  2  3  5  7 15

Mapping Ly (second operand):
 0  1  2  3  5  7 15

Lookup table (Lz -> operation result):
 Lz = 0  --> 0.5
 Lz = 1  --> 0.75
 ...
 Lz = 30 --> 8.0
```

The optimization completes when an optimal solution is found within the specified tolerance

## Requirements

- MATLAB with support for `intlinprog` (Optimization Toolbox and Parallelization Toolbox)
- JSON output support
